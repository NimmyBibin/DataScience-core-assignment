    "1.Word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing by representing words as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings are trained on large amounts of text data using neural network models, such as Word2Vec or GloVe.\n",
    "The underlying idea is that words with similar meanings or that are used in similar contexts should have similar vector representations. During the training process, the model learns to predict the occurrence of words based on their neighboring words. In doing so, it captures the statistical patterns and relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting word embeddings encode semantic information in their vector representations. Similar words are mapped to nearby points in the vector space, while words with different meanings are represented by vectors that are farther apart.

For example, in sentiment analysis, words with positive or negative sentiment tend to have distinct vector representations, allowing the model to identify the sentiment of a sentence.
